About:

REminiscence is a re-implementation of the engine used in the game Flashback
made by Delphine Software and released in 1992. More informations about the
game can be found at [1], [2] and [3].

3DS Version was ported by Romulo Fernandes, with special thanks to 
WinterMute, profi200 and smea.



Compiling:
----------

Run make under msys (from devkitpro)

Installing:
----------

Copy flashback.3dsx, flashback.smdh and flashback.xml to /3ds/flashback/
Create a folder '/3ds/flashback/data' and copy the game files to that folder.


Data Files:
-----------

You will need the original files of the PC (DOS or CD) or Amiga release.
If you have a version distributed by SSI, you'll have to rename the files
and drop the 'ssi' suffix (ie. logosssi.cmd -> logos.cmd).

To hear background music during polygonal cutscenes with the PC version,
you'll need to copy the .mod files of the Amiga version :

	mod.flashback-ascenseur
	mod.flashback-ceinturea
	mod.flashback-chute
	mod.flashback-desintegr
	mod.flashback-donneobjt
	mod.flashback-fin
	mod.flashback-fin2
	mod.flashback-game_over
	mod.flashback-holocube
	mod.flashback-introb
	mod.flashback-jungle
	mod.flashback-logo
	mod.flashback-memoire

	mod.flashback-options1
	mod.flashback-options2
	mod.flashback-reunion
	mod.flashback-taxi
	mod.flashback-teleport2
	mod.flashback-teleporta
	mod.flashback-voyage

To hear voice during in-game dialogues, you'll need to copy the 'VOICE.VCE'
file from the SegaCD version to the DATA directory.
